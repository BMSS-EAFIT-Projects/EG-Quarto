# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the book **General Statistics**, a guide designed for students of the General Statistics course at **EAFIT University**.

This text covers the main topics of the course, from data description and visualization to fundamental concepts in probability and statistical inference. Each chapter is intended to support and reinforce classroom sessions by providing clear explanations, additional examples, and tools for self-learning.

In addition to the theoretical focus, the book integrates computational solutions that allow you to apply statistical concepts in practice. Programming languages such as **Python** and **R** are used, making it easier to develop data analysis skills with modern and widely-used software.

This material has been developed with the goal of supporting both conceptual understanding and the development of applied skills. It is meant to be consulted both inside and outside the classroom and to accompany students throughout the course.

We hope this guide will be a useful, motivating, and formative resource in your journey of learning statistics.
